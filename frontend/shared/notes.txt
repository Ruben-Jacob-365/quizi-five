Instead of different attributes  date and time for quiz creation it is combined to one timestamp for easier arithmetic (new column name eventTime)
The evenTime attribute should adhere to string format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS” eg:- 2023-11-10 14:30:00 
If invalid format is given the status of quiz is marked as terminated


all attributes for all tables are in lowercase letters as saved in the database
